# Chat Application

This is my personal project. I have been working on it for some time now and it is still work in progress. You can find a preview [here](https://krisdevbg.github.io/chatApp/). It is still not finished so do not expect full functionality.

## Usage

Once you open the website you will be on the Home page. You will not be able to chat until you sign in or register. Once you sign in/register you will see the navigation tab "My Chats". By clicking it you will be redirected to the chat page. From there you can either join or create a new chat. The One-Time Chat option is yet to be developed so it doesn't work for now.

## Project Maintenance

This project is currently ongoing and will be maintained by me. If you have any questions, suggestions or any bugs feel free to contact me on linked in.
